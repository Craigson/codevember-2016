# codevember-2016

License is "do whatever you want with it", but keeping in mind: i've tried to name and link all references, libraries and pieces of code i've used. So if you plan to use this repo commercially, or to promote your work profesionally, please don't break the chain and add references, so everyone else can find the sources. Peace! (* I'll write this in a more professional way when i finish codevember)
